# Ian Goodrich's Portfolio Page

#### A simple (incomplete) portfolio page v0.9

#### By Ian Goodrich

## Description

A web portfolio page with elements of css that I've never worked with before.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

simply drag-and-drop onto any web browser.

## Known Bugs

As of the time of writing the page is incomplete. The third panel that was to include examples of theatre and photographic work is empty. Also I lost a lot of time to a strange bug I still haven't figured out. The web browser insisted that all of my images be located in my css folder. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. The panel colors are all scratch placeholders, and I can't seem to get rid of the 'link coloration' on the link to my git repo (you'll see it). Otherwise I'm pleased with he days work. I did not use bootstrap as I find it makes the html cumbersome and hard to work with so I instead opted to do more work with flexbox and css styling. Hope that's okay.

## Support and contact details
I can be contacted at iangoodrich@hotmail.com

## Technologies Used

As stated earlier, I relied on flex and more target css styling than bootstrap.
