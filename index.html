          <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right:20px;">Ian has had a
            varied career, working as everything from a deckhand
            in Alaska to a medical librarian at OHSU; from a road crew worker in
             California and Oregon, to a Dramaturge here in Portland. Many of
             the past twenty years have seen him working in most levels of the
             culinary industry, most recently as the prep kitchen lead at one
             of Portland’s most exclusive retirement communities The Mirabella
             Portland. But after seven years there, six as the lead,
             it was time to move on to a new, more rewarding career. </p>
             <p>To that end, Ian has set out to remake himself and his future
               by embracing his love and talent for problem solving and pattern
              finding, and is learning to code. With a solid beginner’s grasp
             of python 3x, and a less sure but definitely more-than-layman’s
              understanding of HTML, CSS, Django, Ian is looking to expand
             his knowledge with JavaScript, C#, and .Net before the end of
              the year. And if there’s anyone out there who wants to teach
              him Nginx or Apache...he’s a cook, a writer, a photographer,
              makes a mean kombucha, and he’s willing to trade.</p>

          <p>If you'd like to look at some of the work I've done over the past year
            please feel free to look at my
             <a href="https://github.com/LeeMellon/python_work.git" style="text-decoration: none; color: 255, 255, 255, .0;">python_work repo on Github</a>. Some of the
            projects I'm most proud of are my BlackJackFinalPass.py (which really isn't
            my final pass as it turns out), my tictac.py(toe) which is admittedly
            not the most aesthetically pleasing game of tic-tac-toe but I think
           it shows my problem solving skills, and coin_counter.py which is
           very basic script that figures out the least number of coins you
           need make change for any amount of money, but it’s the first
            piece of code that I wrote in my head and had to write down on paper.  </p>
